# WindowsRichTextScreensaver
A screensaver for Windows that can display the contents of a RTF file

## How to use this?
- Create an RTF File in WordPad (It's included in all Windows versions at least since Windows 7 I belive).
- Go to Settings > Personalization > Lock screen, and select Screen saver settings. In the "Screensaversettings" window click on "Settings" and specify the path.
